    <h1> A Brief Analysis of the Declaration of Independence </h1>

    <p> Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature 
      to extend a jurisdiction over these our states. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration & settlement here, no one of 
      which could warrant so strange a pretension: that these were effected at the expense of our own blood & treasure, unassisted by the wealth 
      or the strength of Great Britain: that in constituting indeed our several forms of government, we had adopted one common king, thereby 
      laying a foundation for perpetual league & amity with them: but that submission to their parliament was no part of our constitution, nor 
      ever in idea, if history may be credited: and, we appealed to their native justice and magnanimity as well asto the ties of our common 
      kindred to disavow these usurpations which were likely to interrupt our connection and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice 
      of justice & of consanguinity, and when occasions have been given them, by the regular course of their laws, of removing from their councils 
      the disturbers of our harmony, they have, by their free election, re-established them in power. At this very time too they are permitting 
      their chief magistrate to send over not only soldiers of our common blood, but Scotch & foreign mercenaries to invade & destroy us. These 
      facts have given the last stab to agonizing affection, and manly spirit bids us to renounce forever these unfeeling brethren. We must 
      endeavor to forget our former love for them, and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends. We might 
      have been a free and a great people together; but a communication of grandeur & of freedom it seems is below their dignity. Be it so, since 
      they will have it. The road to happiness & to glory is open to us too. We will tread it apart from them, and acquiesce in the necessity 
      which denounces our eternal separation! </p>
